# Usage-Time-Tracker
In the Android application that I developed, the primary objective was to track the usage time of all installed apps and record the most recent instance each app was used. To accomplish this, I utilized the powerful UsageStatsManager API provided by Android. This API enables access to app usage statistics, including crucial information such as usage time and last time used, for each individual app.
To retrieve the app usage data, the application incorporates robust code implementation that effectively interacts with the UsageStatsManager API. This involves requesting the necessary permissions from the user, specifically the "PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS" permission, which grants access to app usage data on the device.
In addition to the UsageStatsManager API, I integrated Firebase into the application for authentication purposes and secure storage of profile data. This ensures a seamless and reliable user experience while safeguarding sensitive information.
Throughout the development process, I leveraged various Java libraries, including the "total_usage_time" library, to enhance the functionality and performance of the application. These libraries provided additional tools and resources to accurately track app usage and efficiently process the data.
I am delighted to share that this project was qualified as a finalist in the esteemed Smart India Hackathon. The recognition received further validates the innovation and technical proficiency demonstrated in the development of this application.
By effectively utilizing the Access app usage statistics: Android's UsageStatsManager API and implementing the necessary code to retrieve app usage data, combined with the integration of Firebase and the utilization of Java libraries, this application offers users valuable insights into their digital habits and app usage patterns.
